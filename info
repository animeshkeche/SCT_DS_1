TITLE:Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Overview
This Python script visualizes the distribution of the relevant population data in an Excel file (pop.xlsx).The Excel file should contain a column with age data (e.g., 'Age'). Generates a bar chart to illustrate the population count for each category.

Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Functionality
Set Working Directory: The script changes the working directory to where the pop.xlsx file is located.

Data Loading:

It attempts to read the Excel file into a DataFrame.
Handles file-not-found and general exceptions to ensure robustness.
Data Cleaning:

Strips any leading or trailing whitespace from column names.
Converts specified columns to numeric types, handling any non-numeric values gracefully by coercing them to NaN.
Fills any NaN values in these columns with their respective median values to maintain data integrity.
Age Categorization:

Defines three age categories: 0-14, 15-64, and 65+.
Creates a new DataFrame to hold the population counts for these age categories.
Aggregation:

Sums the population across the defined age categories.
Visualization:

Plots a bar chart showing the total population for each age category.
Customizes the chart with labels, a title, and grid lines for better readability.
Output
The output is a bar chart that clearly displays the population distribution across the three age categories, allowing for easy visual interpretation of demographic data.

Usage
Ensure that the pop.xlsx file is located in the specified directory.
Run the script in a Python environment that supports the required libraries (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, etc.).
The script will produce a bar chart visualizing the population age distribution
